Let your work be done by agents — literally!
Make your entire trip fully planned — with just one click. ✅🗺️

🚀 Overview
This is an AI-powered Trip Planner Assistant built using CREW AI, Ollama, Streamlit, LangChain, and Prompt Engineering.

Designed with multiple intelligent agents, this assistant helps you plan an entire trip from scratch based on your preferences, destination, and travel dates. Whether you're a spontaneous traveler or a detail-driven planner — it tailors your journey seamlessly.

🧠 Agents at Work
The system uses a multi-agent architecture to deliver a rich and dynamic travel planning experience:

📍 Location Expert

🎒 Guide Expert

💻 How It Works

Where you’re going

When you’re going and returning

What kind of traveler you are (interests, style)

Let the agents collaborate using CREW AI and generate a custom trip plan.

Receive a detailed itinerary with places, experiences, routes, and more — instantly!
